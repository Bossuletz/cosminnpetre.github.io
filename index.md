### ABOUT ME
I am a graduate student at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest pursuing my Masters in Information Technology Management. I am interested in the Software Development field and am seeking new and exciting opportunities related to this domain.

The skills that I have attained from the previous work experience and also from the university define me and I have found that nothing satisfies me more than meeting new people, developing new relations and solving problems.
